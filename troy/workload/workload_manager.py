class WorkloadManager (object) :
    """
    The `WorkloadManager` class, as its name suggests, manages :class:`Workload`
    instances, i.e. translates, schedules and enacts those instances.

    The internal state of the workload manager is not open for inspection -- but
    the workloads it manages can be exposed for inspection, on request
    (:func:`inspect_workload()`).

    FIXME: how are race conditions handled -- like, a workload is scheduled on
    an overlay, but before dispatching, a pilot in that overlay disappears?
    I guess we should add the option to schedule a single unit, or reschedule
    a complete workload -- but that collides with the state semantics of the
    workload.  Iterative scheduling needs to be implemented anyways though, if
    we want to get any meaningful feedback loop.  Easiest and cleanest is
    probably to allow to repeatedly run through earlier stages again -- DONE
    tasks will then simply be ignored...

    Notes

    . I agree that iterative scheduling has to be implemented. The state model
      of the workload could be extended by adding a RESCHEDULING state. In a
      synchronos model:
      - the manager should 'monitor' the state of its pilots
      - react to a well-defined set of states by transitioning the workload
        into a RESCHEDULING state
      - chose another resource if available or create a new (pilots of an)
        overlay
      - call the scheduler to get a scheduling map of the remaining task (I
        agree, the tasks in state done should be disregarded)
      - enact the scheduling map on the new (pilots of an) overlay.

    . The workload should be open to inspection only to the components of TROY,
      to to the application layer.
