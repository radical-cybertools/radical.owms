    The `Planner` class represents the upper layer, i.e. the application facing

    users.  That API allows to submit application workloads, and to monitor
    their execution progress.

    Internally, the planner will transform the given workload into an internal
    representation upon which the follow-up transformations of the
    :class:`WorkloadManager` class will operate.  It will further derive an
    overlay description suitable to run the workload, which downstream will be
    enacted by the :class:`OverlayManager`.

        create overlay plan (description) from workload.

        Notes

        . Derive implies a workload. Does it make sense to think about a
          def describe_overlay() in which a workload is not provided? I am
          thinking about a stronger notion of 'early binding' in which pilots
          would be created preemptively. Do we see any use case for this?

        . I find the overloading of the term 'planner' confusing. self here is
          a planner. Then there is a private planner that is a planner plug-in
          that has a method with the same name (derive_overlay) of self. I
          believe this overloading hides a confusion about how we use plugins
          in the planner. Plugins should be specific, something that implement
          _alternative_ ways (i.e. algorithms) to solve a well-specified,
          unique, task within the overarching, composite action tat we call
          'planning'. See further comments on the bundles.

        . Do we have a state model for an overlay? I found the states listed
          in constants.py (shall we put them in something like states.py?). Do
          we use/set them in the planner?

        TODO

        . One of the reason to have a planner (Mark will have more to tell us
          soon about all the other functionalities) is to check that the
          workload as a whole makes sense given the available resources.
          Therefore, as part of the actions of the planner I would add both
          spatial and time dimensions of the overlay (as partially done in
          the overlay bundles plugin):
          - Max/Min amount of cores requires by the workload. If Max > of
            the cores available from the accessible resources, raise Exception.
          - Max/Min queing time required by the given workload. If Max > of
            the cores available from the accessible resources, raise Exception.
          - Max/Min degree of concurrency for the given workload - derived
            from the two previous parameters.
