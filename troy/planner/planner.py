    The `Planner` class represents the upper layer, i.e. the application facing

    their execution progress.

    Internally, the planner will transform the given workload into an internal
    representation upon which the follow-up transformations of the
    :class:`WorkloadManager` class will operate.  It will further derive an
    overlay description suitable to run the workload, which downstream will be
    enacted by the :class:`OverlayManager`.

        create overlay plan (description) from workload.

        Notes

        . Derive implies a workload. Does it make sense to think about a
          def describe_overlay() in which a workload is not provided? I am
          thinking about a stronger notion of 'early binding' in which pilots
          would be created preemptively. Do we see any use case for this?

        . I find the overloading of the term 'planner' confusing. self here is
          a planner. Then there is a private planner that is a planner plug-in
          that has a method with the same name (derive_overlay) of self. I
          believe this overloading hides a confusion about how we use plugins
          in the planner. Plugins should be specific, something that implement
          _alternative_ ways (i.e. algorithms) to solve a well-specified,
          unique, task within the overarching, composite action tat we call
          'planning'. See further comments on the bundles.

        . Do we have a state model for an overlay? I found the states listed
          in constants.py (shall we put them in something like states.py?). Do
          we use/set them in the planner?

        TODO

        . One of the reason to have a planner (Mark will have more to tell us
          soon about all the other functionalities) is to check that the
          workload as a whole makes sense given the available resources.
          Therefore, as part of the actions of the planner I would add both
          spatial and time dimensions of the overlay (as partially done in
          the overlay bundles plugin):
          - Max/Min amount of cores requires by the workload. If Max > of
            the cores available from the accessible resources, raise Exception.
          - Max/Min queing time required by the given workload. If Max > of
            the cores available from the accessible resources, raise Exception.
          - Max/Min degree of concurrency for the given workload - derived
            from the two previous parameters.
