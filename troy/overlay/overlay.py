    """
    The `Overlay` class represents a resource overlay which is managed by Troy,
    i.e. in application and user space.  It contains a set of :class:`Pilots`, 
    which represent the resource capabilities of the overlay.

    Overlay instances are owned by the :class:`OverlayManager` class -- only
    that class should change its composition and state (but Overlay may get
    created by the :class:`troy.Planner`).

    An overlay undergoes a series of transformations before being able to run
    workloads.  Those transformations are orchestrated by the overlay manager.
    To support that orchestration, an overlay will be lockable, and it will have
    a state attribute.  The valid states are listed below.

    Internally, a overlay is represented by a set of :class:`troy.Pilot`
    instances.  As the overlay undergoes transformations, it is enriched by
    additional information, although those are kept solely within the
    :class:`Pilot` instances -- see there for more details.

    The overlay transformations are:

    * *Scheduling:* A overlay is mapped onto resourced.

    * *Dispatching:* A scheduled overlay is provisioned to the respective
      resources.


    Overlay States
    ---------------

    An overlay can be in different states, depending on the transformations
    performed on it.  Specifically, it can be in `DESCRIBED`,
    `TRANSLATED`, `SCHEDULED`, `PROVISIONED`, `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`.

    A overlay enters the overlay manager in `DESCRIBED` state, and all follow-up
    state transitions are kept within the overlay manager.

    Those states are ill defined in case of partial transformations -- if, for
    example, a scheduling step may only schedule some of the pilots, but not
    others.  As a general rule, a overlay will remain in a state until the
    transformation has been performed on all applicable overlay components
    (pilots).

    Even on fully transformed overlay, the actual overlay state may not be
    trivial to determine -- for example, a specific pilot may have failed, and
    my turn out to be impossible to re-run on its target resource, so it needs
    to be rescheduled to a different resource.  Those feedback loops are
    considered out-of-scope for Troy at this point, so that state transitions
    are considered irreversible.
