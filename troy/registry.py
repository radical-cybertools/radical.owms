class _Registry (object) :
    """
    This registry class is only used internally in Troy -- it serves as
    a central hub for keeping workload and overlay instances around.

    It is in general not a favourable design to have large, all-visible
    registries in a multi-component software stack, as ownership of state
    transitions can easily become blurry, and as a registry can also become
    a performance bottleneck on frequent queries -- so why are we doing this?

    First of all, state transitions in Troy *are* blurry to some extent, as Troy
    aims to support a variety of state diagram transitions, and thus the order
    of transitions is not pre-defined (first derive overlay then schedule CUs,
    or vice versa?).  Also, the ownership of state transitions for a workload is
    not easily scoped (the :class:`Planner` will move a workload from `NEW` to
    `PLANNED`, the :class:`WorkloadManager` will move it from `PLANNED` to
    `TRANSLATED`, etc.  And, finally, we want to allow for re-scheduling,
    re-translation, re-planning etc, which would require us to pass control of
    a workload back and forth between different modules.  Finally, this seems to
    be useful for inspection and introspection of Troy activities related to
    specific workload instances.

    In that context, a registry seems the (much) lesser of two devils.

    The registry class will allow to register workload and overlay instances
    (duh), and to acquire/release control over it.  The module which acquires
    control needs to ascertain that the respective workload and overlay
    instances are in a usable state for that module -- the registry is neither
    interpreting nor enforcing any state model on the managed instances.
    Neither will this class perform garbage collection -- active unregistration
    will remove instances from the registry, but not enforce a deletion.

    Workloads and overlays are considered lockable, i.e. we can call
    `entity.lock()` on them to retrieve an rlock.  `acquire` will return
    a locked entity, `release()` will unlock it again.

    This is a singleton class.  We assume that Workload *and* Overlay IDs are
    unique.
