# Tired of Resource OverlaYs

### Installation Notes

At this stage, the devel branches of saga-python, radical.utils, and bigjob should
be used with TROY.  (If these are not manually installed, the
TROY installer may pull in non-devel versions.)

To set up the TROY environment, use 

pip install .

Or, to make extra-sure TROY is installed correctly with all trace
of previous installations removed:

pip uninstall troy; rm -rf ./build; pip install .

### Configuration

You need a configuration file in the location "~/.troy.cfg".
An example is provided in this directory ("dot_troy_example.cfg"), you can copy
that to "~/.troy.cfg" and customize to your environment.

### Note to developers:

The development branch is `devel`, all developers should branch off 'devel' when
implementing new features.  Feature branches are named `feature/xyz`, and are
only merged into devel after coordinating with the other developers.

Releases are tagged on the `master` branch -- only the release manager will merge
from `devel` to `master`, to prepare for a release.

An usual development workflow should look like:

```
git clone git@github.com:saga-project/troy.git # get repostory
cd troy                                        # 
git checkout devel                             # switch to devel branch
git checkout -b feature/world_domination       # create a feature branch from there
vim troy/world_domination.py                   # do the deed...
vim tests/test_world_domination.py             #
git commit -am 'we now dominate the world'     # commit your changes
git push origin feature/world_domination       # sync with github
```

The last command will ensure that your (until then only locally existing) branch
will be mirrored in the central repository, and is available for other
developers.

Once the group agreed on merging, you would run:

```
git checkout devel
git pull                               # get updates from github
git checkout feature/world_domination
git pull                               # get updates from github
git merge devel                        # make sure branch is in sync with devel
run_my_tests                           # do it!
git checkout devel
git merge feature/world_domination     # merge your feature branch
git push origin                        # sync with github
git branch -d feature/world_domination # remove feature branch
```

If unsure about anything, ask Andre ;)
